# Pocket Party

Our system gives its users the opportunity to play multiplayer smartphone joystick games. Each game provides the users with a multiplayer gaming experience that allows them to play a game using
their smartphones as controllers. The game is displayed on a desktop screen, while users interact with the game using their smartphones as joysticks. Four buttons are displayed on the phone screen,
each of them corresponding to a certain direction - left, right, up and down. Players can connect multiple smartphones to the game simultaneously, enabling multiplayer gameplay with friends or other
users. People can create and join lobbies on the desktop website. The joysticks are also accesses through the web.

## Cosmic Co-Pilot

Cosmic Co-Pilot is one of the games users are able to play. The game includes a spaceship that is flying in space. It is controlled by up to two users that need to cooperate and move the ship left, right, up
and down, trying to escape the flying asteroids around it. When the final boss appears, the spaceship automatially begins to shoot at him while the players continue to control its movements. If the boss
is killed, the players win the game. If the players crash the ship into an asteroid or the final boss manages to shoot the ship causing it to lose its "lives", the game is over and the players lose.
